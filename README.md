# How to contribute
Each file has something like this

```
templates/userpage/user.html:46 <- This can be ignored its not relevent to translation
msgid "Mastery" <- This is the ID in english
msgstr "" <- Here comes the translation in the langauge you're translating in.
```
Example:
```
msgid "Mastery"
msgstr "Mastery" <- translation for that language
```

For `msgid "On 🐈"` Please translate "On" to the langauge and add the cat emoji at the end

Thank you for contributing <3
